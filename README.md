**How it Works:**

The EA Donald Duck code is written in MQL5 and operates as follows:

1. Initialization: The OnInit() function is called when the EA is initialized. Any necessary initialization code can be added here.

2. Tick Event: The OnTick() function is called on every tick of the market. It reads the exchange volumes using the MarketInfo() function and checks if the volume exceeds the specified threshold.

3. Reversal Pattern Detection: If the volume exceeds the threshold, the EA calls the DetectReversalPattern() function to analyze the market for a reversal pattern. The length of the pattern can be adjusted using the reversalPatternLength input.

4. Entry and Exit Signals: If a reversal pattern is detected, the OpenTrade() function is called to open a trade. Otherwise, the CloseTrade() function is called to close any existing trades.

5. Opening a Trade: The OpenTrade() function calculates the stop loss and take profit prices based on the current bid and ask prices and the input values for stopLoss and takeProfit. It then sends an order using the OrderSend() function.

6. Closing a Trade: The CloseTrade() function loops through all open trades and checks if they are for the same symbol and have a magic number of 0 (indicating they were opened by the EA). It then closes the trade using the OrderClose() function.
